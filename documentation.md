## 1. Overview

   The DCISS Chat Service is a messaging application designed to emulate core functionalities of popular messaging apps like WhatsApp. 
   It allows users to send and receive messages, both in individual and group settings, thereby supporting real-time communication across a network.  
   The project is built on Java and leverages client-server architecture to handle data transmission, user management, and message processing. 
   The goal is to provide a robust, scalable, and secure platform for text-based communication, with potential extensions for media sharing and enhanced user interaction.
   
   The system is divided into several main components, each responsible for different aspects of the application:  

   * **Client**: Handles user interaction, sends messages to the server, and receives updates.  
   Implemented in files like ClientMsg.java, which manages the client-side messaging logic.  

  * **Server**: Manages all clients, processes incoming packets, and routes them to the appropriate recipients.  
  The server functionality is encapsulated in files such as ServerMsg.java and ServerPacketProcessor.java, which together handle client connections, message dispatch, and basic server operations.  

  * **Packet**: Serves as the basic data structure for messages sent across the network, defined in Packet.java.  
  It includes essential data such as source and destination IDs, as well as the message content itself.

  * **Packet Processor**: A component that processes the packets based on their type and content.  
  This logic is split across PacketProcessor.java for generic processing and ServerPacketProcessor.java for server-specific handling.
